Internet Affordability in Zimbabwe – Machine Learning Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project explores internet affordability in Zimbabwe using data-driven analysis and machine learning models. It investigates how geographic, economic, and demographic factors influence affordability perceptions and internet access.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze internet affordability using survey and performance data

Identify key predictors of affordability perception

Compare performance of machine learning models (Random Forest, etc.)

Provide insights for policymakers, telecoms, and regulators
